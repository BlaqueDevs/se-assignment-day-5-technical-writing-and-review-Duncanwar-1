- Understanding your audience helps to know the if you need to explain deeply or you will be straight to the point and which technical terms to use and not use.

## 4. What techniques can you use to ensure your content is accessible to those with limited technical knowledge?
- Do not use technical vocabularies, use real-world examples.
- Explain in depth with simple words.
## 5. Why is it important to use plain language instead of technical jargon in your writing?
- Because there may be a non-technical person who won't get what you're saying and the reason for writing is to simplify the content, not adding additional words
